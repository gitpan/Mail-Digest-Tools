Hi Chris,
Thank you for the reply.
Please bear with me if I appear to be a little naive, but this is my 
problem. 
I've already opened a file and have the data in an array.
I want to perform this operation on that array. How do I do that ?
open (FILE,$file);
@my_array = <FILE> ;
now my_array contains the day limited by START_PATTERN and 
END_PATTERN.
How do I filter it out from there ?

Thomas.
