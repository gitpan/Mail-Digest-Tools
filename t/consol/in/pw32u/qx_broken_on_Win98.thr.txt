qw// seems to be
broken when perl is built with GNU tools, and dmake on Win98.
Or is it something wrong with my system?

here it is from a bash shell:

Here is some id:
C:\s\home\greg>perl -v

C:\perl\bin>.\perl -e "qx/cd/"

C:\perl\bin>.\perl -e "system( q/cd/ )"
C:\perl\bin

What do you make of this?

Works fine, once you know what the difference between system and qx is (read
"perldoc -f system" and "perldoc perlop" [search for `STRING` in the later
one]). 

(on FreeBSD):
frisco% pwd
/usr
frisco% perl -v

frisco% perl -e 'qx{pwd};'      
frisco% perl -e 'print qx{pwd};'
/usr
frisco% 

(on Windows XP):
C:\>cd
C:\

Hope this helps

I get the same behaviour on Win2k, with both AS-built perl and 
Mingw-built perl (cmd.exe shell).

Should it be different ? (Not a rhetorical question ..... I don't know 
the answer :-)

Cheers,

And?  What is it that you think is wrong?  Have you read the 
documentation for qx()?  It's not the same as system() -- it's 
the same as backticks.

It's not impossible for something to be broken in perl, but 
whenever you suspect it is, remember that it's orders of 
magnitude more likely that what's broken is your program or 
your understanding of the situation.
