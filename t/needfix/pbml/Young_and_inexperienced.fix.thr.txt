Maybe try gzip to compress the excess weight.

I just turned 19 and well I am new to this area. I have recently gotten 
myself in shape and started treating my body as a temple!  I lost like 
50 pounds and now I am back down to the weight I should be... Tipping 
the scales at just over 100 pounds.  I am only 5'1", but when I lost the 
weight I exercised and lifted weights so my body got real tight... yeah 
tight everywhere.

The only thing that didnt lose weight is my chest.  I am still a 34D, I 
am a bit top heavy but they dont sag and they are both pierced.

Someone please check out my profile, I dont care about age so look me 
up on.
