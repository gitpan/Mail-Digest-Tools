Hi Chris,
Thank you for the reply.
Please bear with me if I appear to be a little naive, but this is my 
problem. 
I've already opened a file and have the data in an array.
I want to perform this operation on that array. How do I do that ?
open (FILE,$file);
@my_array = <FILE> ;
now my_array contains the day limited by START_PATTERN and 
END_PATTERN.
How do I filter it out from there ?

Thomas.

This will do it, if I understand the problem correctly.

#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my @a;

while(<DATA>) {
next unless /START_PATTERN/../END_PATTERN/;
push @a, /([a-z]+(?:\s+[a-z]+)*)/;
}
print "$_\n" for @a;

__DATA__
sldjflsdfjlskd
START_PATTERN lsdjflsd
lskdfljsld lkjsldflskd
sldjflsjdfsldfjlsjdflj
ljsdfsdf END_PATTERN

The regular expression captures lowercased text _and_ optional space 
followed by lowercase text, just like in thw sample data you have 
here.

Hi Folks,

How do you do a grep over multiple lines in perl?
I have a file that is already read into an array and the array looks 
like this.

sldjflsdfjlskd          (line0)
START_PATTERN lsdjflsd  (line1)
lskdfljsld lkjsldflskd  (line2)
sldjflsjdfsldfjlsjdflj  (line3)
ljsdfsdf END_PATTERN    (line4)

I want to grab the stuff between START_PATTERN and END_PATTERN 
and dump it into a different array.
It can be done in a couple of lines, I'm sure, but How do you do 
with a one liner or some other short way?

I tried to use Text::Balanced qw(extract_tagged) as a different 
way to do this .. but somehow it does not work for me :-(.
Could somebody also point me to some sites where they show examples 
of text manipulating perl modules at work ?

Thank you very much.
Thomas.
