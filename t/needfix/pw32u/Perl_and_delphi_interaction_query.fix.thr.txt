Can't help with delphi but in view of your analysis try using
a .xpm image, which can be included in your script like so...

$mw->Pixmap( 'myicon', -data => loadIcon());
$mw->Icon( -image => 'myicon' );

sub loadIcon
{
return <<'EOT';

};
EOT
}

Huge thanks to Lynn Rickards, who suggested embedding the image into the
perl script.

Just so that those wanting to do the same know how...

$mw->Pixmap( 'myicon', -data => loadIcon());
$mw->Icon( -image => 'myicon' );

sub loadIcon
{
return <<'EOT';

};
EOT
}

Guys,

I inherited a delphi GUI, which is too complicated to even consider
re-writing.

So, I added a button that fires of a perl .exe, made with perlapp.

The perl .exe works perfectly when run alone. It uses Tk and a ROText widget
to display the progress of the script, and I changed the Tk icon in the
corner to my own, like this...

my $mw = MainWindow -> new (-title => "   $title $version");
$mw -> withdraw;
$mw -> minsize (qw(600 400));
my $status = $mw -> ROText()->pack(-expand, 1, -fill, 'both');
my $button = $mw -> Button (
-text , 'Cancel',
-command, \&finished,
) -> pack (-side, 'bottom');
my $icon = $mw->Photo(-file => 'SpikeWare.gif');
$mw->idletasks;
$mw->iconimage($icon);
$mw -> Popup;
$mw -> focus;

However, when I run this by clicking on the button from the delphi created
gui, the script just dies.

If I then remove the 3 lines that change the icon:
my $icon = $mw->Photo(-file => 'SpikeWare.gif');
$mw->idletasks;
$mw->iconimage($icon); <- this seems to be the main culprit.

It works perfectly under all circumstances.

I really want to use my icon, so does anyone know why it won't run when
fired off from delphi?

THanks,

R.

Richard,

Can you provide the Delphi code that you are using to launch the PerlApp?
