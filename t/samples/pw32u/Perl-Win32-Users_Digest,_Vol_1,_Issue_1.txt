I'm only guessing, but wouldn't anything requiring Math::Pari
work as well with Math::BigInt::Calc instead?

Math::Pari, or native PARI, is used more by the mathematical
'heavy mob' to do advanced number theoretic calculations, and
I'd have thought that using it just to multiply a few 128-bit
numbers or similar was like using a hammer to crack a nut
(unless tip-top performance is vital, which I suppose it
might be if one is encrypting a long data stream).

Just out of curiosity, in what sense did you find Math::Pari
a PoC?

Did you have trouble building it? I did a quick web search,
and saw a couple of plaintive posts by people having trouble
building it on AIX. I'm just wondering in case I ever need to
use it.


Cheers

Please let me know if you get it going  - I gave up

I think I got as far as Math::Pari or something like that - boy was
that a piece of crap IMO.

Guys,

I inherited a delphi GUI, which is too complicated to even consider
re-writing.

So, I added a button that fires of a perl .exe, made with perlapp.

The perl .exe works perfectly when run alone. It uses Tk and a ROText widget
to display the progress of the script, and I changed the Tk icon in the
corner to my own, like this...

my $mw = MainWindow -> new (-title => "   $title $version");
$mw -> withdraw;
$mw -> minsize (qw(600 400));
my $status = $mw -> ROText()->pack(-expand, 1, -fill, 'both');
my $button = $mw -> Button (
-text , 'Cancel',
-command, \&finished,
) -> pack (-side, 'bottom');
my $icon = $mw->Photo(-file => 'SpikeWare.gif');
$mw->idletasks;
$mw->iconimage($icon);
$mw -> Popup;
$mw -> focus;

However, when I run this by clicking on the button from the delphi created
gui, the script just dies.

If I then remove the 3 lines that change the icon:
my $icon = $mw->Photo(-file => 'SpikeWare.gif');
$mw->idletasks;
$mw->iconimage($icon); <- this seems to be the main culprit.

It works perfectly under all circumstances.

I really want to use my icon, so does anyone know why it won't run when
fired off from delphi?

THanks,

R.

Richard,

Can you provide the Delphi code that you are using to launch the PerlApp?

Chris
