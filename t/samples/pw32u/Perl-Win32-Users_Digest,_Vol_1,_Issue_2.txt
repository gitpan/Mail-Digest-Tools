I could not get this (Math::Pari) to build on Win32 under Cygwin. It was
a known bug when I did a net crawl to find out more info. Anyone any
more information? Activestate don't supply the module either, so I was
seeking to build under the latest Cygwin port / toolset instead.

I had no problem building under Linux.

Can't help with delphi but in view of your analysis try using
a .xpm image, which can be included in your script like so...

$mw->Pixmap( 'myicon', -data => loadIcon());
$mw->Icon( -image => 'myicon' );

sub loadIcon
{
return <<'EOT';

};
EOT
}

I successfully built it last night using "cpan" under Cygwin
on my WinXP-Pro system running the latest Cygwin updates.
I am using Cygwin's Perl 5.8.2-1 (the current version available).
Also, I may have required Cygwin's perl-libwin32 0.191-1
(the current version of this library) package. I am
using the most recent version of gcc and gnu make. Hope
this helps.

Subject: qx// broken on Win98

qw// seems to be
broken when perl is built with GNU tools, and dmake on Win98.
Or is it something wrong with my system?

here it is from a bash shell:

Here is some id:
C:\s\home\greg>perl -v

C:\perl\bin>.\perl -e "qx/cd/"

C:\perl\bin>.\perl -e "system( q/cd/ )"
C:\perl\bin

What do you make of this?

Works fine, once you know what the difference between system and qx is (read
"perldoc -f system" and "perldoc perlop" [search for `STRING` in the later
one]). 

(on FreeBSD):
frisco% pwd
/usr
frisco% perl -v

frisco% perl -e 'qx{pwd};'      
frisco% perl -e 'print qx{pwd};'
/usr
frisco% 


(on Windows XP):
C:\>cd
C:\

Hope this helps

I get the same behaviour on Win2k, with both AS-built perl and 
Mingw-built perl (cmd.exe shell).

Should it be different ? (Not a rhetorical question ..... I don't know 
the answer :-)

And?  What is it that you think is wrong?  Have you read the 
documentation for qx()?  It's not the same as system() -- it's 
the same as backticks.

It's not impossible for something to be broken in perl, but 
whenever you suspect it is, remember that it's orders of 
magnitude more likely that what's broken is your program or 
your understanding of the situation.

Thanks. Here too,

the right results. Trying that with system

That's interesting. That first line must be coming out as STDERR
and the O is STDOUT, I think. There is no error in 

An error message about mistaken specification of directory.

Subject: Re: qx// broken on Win98

Looking up the docs for system,

           The return value is the exit status of the program as returned
           by the "wait" call. To get the actual exit value shift right by
           eight (see below). See also "exec". This is *not* what you want
           to use to capture the output from a command, for that you should
           use merely backticks or "qx//", as described in "`STRING`" in
           perlop. Return value of -1 indicates a failure to start the
           program (inspect $! for the reason).

I always interpreted that passage to mean it was optional, which one 
you used, if you were only interested in the output!

For qx//

   qx/STRING/
   `STRING`
           A string which is (possibly) interpolated and then executed as a
           system command with "/bin/sh" or its equivalent. Shell
           wildcards, pipes, and redirections will be honored. The
           collected standard output of the command is returned; standard
           error is unaffected. 

What does that unaffected mean? The same thing happens to it as any
error message the program generates?

More than likely it's something a little more complex than straight out 
multiplication - perhaps a modular exponentiation - ie a calculation of 
($x**$y)%$m, where $x, $y, and $m are big integers. And the numbers may 
well be bigger than 128 bits. I think the current recommendations for 
RSA encryption is a modulus of 2048 bits.

I just did a comparison of M::BI, M::GMP, and M::Pari for a modular 
exponentiation where $x, $y, and $m each comprised 300 decimal digits.

M::BI took 27 seconds
M::GMP took 0.01 seconds
M::Pari took 0.40 seconds

Perl 5.6:
ppm install http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppmpackages/Math-Pari.ppd

Perl 5.8
ppm install http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppms/Math-Pari.ppd

It builds easily on native win32 - but to do that you also need to 
download the Pari-GP (or is it GP-Pari?) source. You don't need to do 
anything with that source, btw - Math::Pari simply needs to be able to 
find it at the build stage. Once Math::Pari is built, you can delete the 
Pari-GP source if you want.

Cheers,
Rob

Huge thanks to Lynn Rickards, who suggested embedding the image into the
perl script.

Just so that those wanting to do the same know how...

$mw->Pixmap( 'myicon', -data => loadIcon());
$mw->Icon( -image => 'myicon' );

sub loadIcon
{
return <<'EOT';

};
